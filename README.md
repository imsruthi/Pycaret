# Sales Prediction Project


This project is a sales prediction model designed to help businesses forecast their sales based on advertising spending in various marketing channels. The project uses Python and popular data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. It demonstrates the steps involved in data analysis, model training, and prediction, providing a valuable resource for understanding sales trends and optimizing marketing strategies.


- Data Exploration: The project begins with a comprehensive data exploration phase, visualizing the relationships between advertising channels and sales through informative histograms and correlation analysis.

- Machine Learning: It showcases the application of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model that estimates sales based on advertising budgets.

- Evaluation Metrics: The project computes key evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy in predicting sales.

- Real-World Application: Sales prediction is a vital aspect of business planning and marketing strategies. This project demonstrates how businesses can leverage data science techniques to make informed decisions and optimize their advertising budgets.
