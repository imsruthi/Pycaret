# Sales Prediction Project


This project is a sales prediction model designed to help businesses forecast their sales based on advertising spending in various marketing channels. The project uses Python and popular data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. It demonstrates the steps involved in data analysis, model training, and prediction, providing a valuable resource for understanding sales trends and optimizing marketing strategies.


- Data Exploration: The project begins with a comprehensive data exploration phase, visualizing the relationships between advertising channels and sales through informative histograms and correlation analysis.

- Machine Learning: It showcases the application of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model that estimates sales based on advertising budgets.

- Evaluation Metrics: The project computes key evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy in predicting sales.

- Real-World Application: Sales prediction is a vital aspect of business planning and marketing strategies. This project demonstrates how businesses can leverage data science techniques to make informed decisions and optimize their advertising budgets.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

**Student Performance Prediction Project

Welcome to my Student Performance Prediction Project! üìö‚úèÔ∏è

This project delves into the fascinating world of data-driven insights into student performance. By analyzing student data and using a Linear Regression model, we aim to predict students' final grades. Understanding the factors that influence academic success can help educators and students make informed decisions and set the stage for better educational outcomes.

Key Highlights:

Data Analysis: We start by exploring the dataset, focusing on attributes like first-period grades (G1), second-period grades (G2), the number of past class failures, study time, and absences. We uncover valuable insights by visualizing and understanding the data.

Machine Learning: The project leverages a Linear Regression model to predict students' final grades based on their academic history and other factors. This machine learning technique is widely used for regression problems.

Accuracy Assessment: The accuracy of the predictive model is measured to ensure its reliability. We calculate the model's score and evaluate how well it predicts student performance.

Real-World Application: The ability to forecast student grades can provide insights to educators, students, and institutions, allowing them to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to enhance student outcomes.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
